Fizzbuzz
Week 4 Maker's Academy Pre-course

This challenge was an introduction to Test Driven Development(TDD)
and Pair Programming.

What is Fizzbuzz?

Fizzbuzz has the following specification:
* The program can be passed a number.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, it returns the message "Fizz".
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, it returns the message "Buzz".
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it ignores the previous two rules and returns the message "Fizzbuzz".
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

I paired on this challenge with @AlexSusanu
